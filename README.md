# Business-Insights-for-Wave-Hair-Studio
The Waves salon has been on the market for six months, delighting clients with curly hairstyles. Like any business, they are focused on increasing profitability. Their reporting is managed manually in Google Sheets, and they provided us with exported data. The goal is to analyze the structure of income and expenses: how much is spent on operations, what revenue is generated, the main expense categories, and the key sources of income. 

Additionally, the analysis should address the following questions:
How much the salon spends on promotions and whether these investments pay off:
a. analyze promo campaigns to see which bring the greatest effect in attracting clients â€” which promo codes are used most often;
b. measure how much revenue the salon loses due to discounts;
c. calculate the average check amount for each promo campaign.

Other than that, analyze which products the salon sells and which services it provides, identifying those most in demand among clients.
