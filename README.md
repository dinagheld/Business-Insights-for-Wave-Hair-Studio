# Business Insights for Waves Hair Studio
## Business context
The Waves salon is based in Russia and has been on the market for six months, occupying the niche of serving clients with curly hairstyles. Like any business, they are focused on increasing profitability. Their reporting is managed manually in Google Sheets, and they provided us with transaction data across six months of operation. The goal is to analyze the structure of income and expenses: how much is spent on operations, what revenue is generated, the main expense categories, and the key sources of income. <br/>

Additionally, the analysis should address the following questions: <br/>

a. are there promo campaigns that bring serious loss in revenue; <br/>
b. if yes, how much revenue the salon loses due to discounts; <br/>
c. what is the average check amount for each promo campaign. <br/>

## Data structure and its description
The log the salon has provided us with [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/160pAX3ODxru7RwWPJvVTerMdSHq6qHtPuBcx97F6mGg/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/160pAX3ODxru7RwWPJvVTerMdSHq6qHtPuBcx97F6mGg/edit?usp=sharing)
<br/>is stored in Google Sheets and has 2 sheets: export and promocodes. In the 'export' sheet we have all the transactions the salon encountered with, containing both income and expense content for the 6 months of operation. The 'promocodes' sheet holds information about marketing campaigns employed to support the sales, revealing data about the campaign that was used and the discount given to customers.  <br/>
 <br/>
Here is the list of the fields disclosed in the log: <br/>
<br/>
**EXPORT Sheet:** <br/>
 <br/>
**ID** - A unique identification code is assigned to both income and expense transactions. The identifier is entered manually and represents a sequential transaction number. <br/>
<br/>
**Transaction** - Information indicating whether the transaction relates to income or expenses <br/>
<br/>
**Payment type** - Information about the payment method: cashless or cash payment  <br/>
<br/>
**Category** - Name of the product or service being paid for <br/>
<br/>
**Order date and time** - Despite its naming the field disclosed only date, no time specified <br/>
<br/>
**Promocode** - Promocode for the discount if used <br/>
<br/>
**Standard price** - The cost of the product or service before discount <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
**PROMOCODES Sheet:**  <br/>
<br/> 
**Promocode** - Promocode for a discount<br/>
<br/>
**ID campaign** - Unique identifier of the marketing campaign associated with the promo code<br/>
<br/>

<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
## Data cleaning and preprocessing
Prior to working with the dataset it was cleaned from duplicates, manual errors and anomalies. The NULL values in the *Standard price* column were replaced with corresponding values based on the price list after consulting with the stakeholders who confirmed it's the right way to proceed. The cells containing blank spaces were trimmed, and the formatting was fixed. 
<br/>
<br/>
## Data enrichment
The new attributes and calculated fields were added to the initial dataset for further analysis. The new fileds are colored in blue while initial ones are marked green. 
Since the salon renders hair services as well as sells hair products, the categorization between service and physical product was introduced to understand the content of revenue ('Item type' field).
In order to dive into analysis of promo campaigns the information about applied discount (percent and absolute value) was mapped to each transaction. Based on that we were able to derive the amount after discount - the net amount received by the salon. 
Here is the working file of the project [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QkQK2eT2JNJG01Bqg1U3KKvhJsrDnqTRqDMwOBiddk4/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QkQK2eT2JNJG01Bqg1U3KKvhJsrDnqTRqDMwOBiddk4/edit?usp=sharing)

## Executive summary report

### Profitablity analysis
The Waves salon team has recently entered the market. Profitability analysis shows the business is operating at a surplus, covering all essential expenses. Monthly revenue remains stable without significant fluctuations. The majority of revenue is generated by services, primarily haircuts and styling. While the salon also sells hair products, their contribution to overall income remains minimal.

### Revenue breakdown
The six-month revenue breakdown indicates that haircuts by Senior Stylists generate largest portion of revenue (the most expensive service), with many clients also opting to combine haircuts with styling services.

<br/>
<br/>

### Expense breakdown
Payroll is the dominant cost driver and its portion remains consistent and stable over 6 months (except May: several vacations took place in April, the salary is paid in the following month). This indicates the business is labor-intensive and employees are working full-time on a salary basis. The second largest expense category is advertising and promotional costs. As a newcomer to the market, the salon actively invests in ads and marketing campaigns to attract customers. The business needs a consistent stream of customers just to cover its large, unavoidable payroll and rent expenses before making a profit.

### Customer demand for services and hair products
The total number of services rendered fluctuates between 170 and 210. We see a clear drop in total services in April. This validates the claim that reduced staff capacity directly led to reduced sales. 
<img width="971" height="514" alt="Demand for haircuts and styling services remains steady with a slight decrease in April due to vacation of some employees" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bca2a5f1-5175-448a-a698-18b416e28220" />
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The demand for Hair gel began its sustained rise starting in April.
This could suggest that clients who previously purchased a styling service were educated on or sold the hair gel needed to maintain the style at home, leading to a surge in product sales in the following months. This is a classic example of successful service-to-product upselling. <br/>
Although the demand for shampoo alone is higher than combo "shampoo and conditioner", the analysis of profit margin has shown that selling shampoo and conditioner in a bundle brings higher margin compared to selling shampoo alone. 
<img width="971" height="522" alt="Demand for hair products remained stable  The increasing trend for hair gel might indicate that more people may have become aware of the importance of gel for styling curly hair (1)" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a0cefa78-3b37-4e41-8b89-ffed3220cb1f" />

### Performance of marketing campaigns
Key recommendation for the client — to start maintaining a customer database and record in the sales journal who exactly purchased a product or received a service. This will make it possible to track new clients and evaluate the effectiveness of promotional campaigns in attracting them.

It is also advisable to reconsider the allocation of promotional expenses. The two campaigns — Telegram posts and VK advertising — resulted in the greatest lost revenue due to discounts, and the average check under these promotions was the lowest. It is still unclear whether such campaigns actually attract new clients, making it difficult to assess their profitability. At present, they appear unprofitable.

## Recommendations to the client
**Primary Leverage for Profitability:** <br/>
Given the cost structure, the salon must focus on marketing, customer retention, upselling services, and maximizing the productivity of its highly paid staff. Since staff is the greatest asset and the core factor of operation it is advisable to introduce motivational policies for proactivity and high performance. This policies might include both financial and non-financial incentives, like paying comission for selling hair products, commisions for retaining loyal customers, professional development workshops and certifications, comfortable working conditions and pleasant workplace environment. Additionally, gathering employee feedback on what incentives would motivate them most could provide valuable insights.
<br/>
<br/>
**Risk management:** <br/>
The business is vulnerable to any downturn in customer demand. A few slow weeks could quickly impact profitability due to the high fixed costs. It is highly recommended to plan employees vacations in a way that minimizes the impact on revenue. It is advisable to reshape the revenue structure by stimulating sales of hair products. The salon might consider opening an online shop with hair products targeted for people with curly hair along with offline sales from salon. <br/>
<br/>
The product range of gels could be expanded, for example by adding options with different levels of hair fixation. It may also be beneficial to introduce other types of styling products suitable for creating curls. Additionally, expanding the assortment with other hair care products such as masks, sprays, creams, special brushes for curly hair could increase customer interest. Conducting a customer survey may also help identify attractive new product combinations.
<br/>
<br/>
**Customer segmentation** <br/>
To evaluate the success of a certain promo campaign it is highly recommended to start maintaining a customer database and record in the sales journal who exactly purchased a product or received a service. Customer registration would allow owners to monitor inflow of new customers and calculate the cost of customer acquisition within certain marketing campaign.  Other important metrcis could be derived from customer database: Customer Lifetime Value, Purchase Frequency / Visit Frequency, Retention Rate & Churn Rate etc.. <br/>
By calculating these metrics the salon can make strategic decisions on who to target, what to offer them, and how to allocate payroll and advertising budgets for the highest possible return.
